# Vestige Store UI (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This project is a lightweight React + Vite starter for a Vestige-themed health & wellness store UI.

## How to use
1. Upload this folder to your GitHub repository (via browser upload).
2. Netlify is already connected to your repo: set build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist`.
3. Netlify will install dependencies and build the site.

> You can later replace images and product details in `src/data/products.js`.
